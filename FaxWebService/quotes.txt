["And as big as the clouds may look, every storm eventually passes.","You have no enemies.","It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.","Skip the villain arc.","Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust.","The only thing that is constant is change. - Heraclitus.","Never let yourself be saddened by a separation - Miyamoto Musashi."]
